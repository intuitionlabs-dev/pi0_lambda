The real `DroidRldsDataset` implementation is not needed when running Piper
configs but `openpi.training.config` imports the symbol unconditionally.  To
avoid an ImportError when that module is missing we provide a lightweight
fallback that raises a clear error if someone actually tries to instantiate
it.
